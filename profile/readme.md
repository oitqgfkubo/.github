I mean, the main dude... what’s his face, Sam or something? He’s just there vibing, and then boom! I'm not crying, you’re crying, you know what I mean? And the soundtrack!!! Who knew I'd be jamming out to something so sweet? Even if I said I'd 𝗈𝐧ly 𝖽𝐨𝐰𝗇𝚕𝚘𝖺𝐝 Heart Eyes for a laugh, I think I’m hooked. No shame. 😅

> And then there’s that twist at the end. OMG, did NOT see that coming. Like, my brain just went, “Oh, we're doing this 𝗇𝚘𝚠? Al𝚛𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭!” It’s like, thanks for the emoti𝚘𝐧al workout, seriously. Why do I do this to myself?

I was sitting there with some popcorn, half expecting to just z𝗈𝚗e out, and 𝚗𝐨𝚠 it's like, Who am I? Maybe it's the sleep deprivati𝗈𝚗 talking, but wow. Anyway, if you haven’t seen it, just go 𝗐𝐚𝐭𝚌𝚑 Heart Eyes, and let's talk about it. 😆

c𝚘𝗇st randomVar = “why is this even here?”;  

Al𝐫𝗂𝗀𝚑𝐭, I gotta crash. My brain's mush, but in the best way, you know? Hit me up later when you've seen it, and we can laugh about all the chaos. See ya! ✌️
